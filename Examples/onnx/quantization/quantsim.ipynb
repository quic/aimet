    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform quantization simulation (quantsim). Quantsim is an AIMET feature that adds quantization simulation ops (also called fake quantization ops sometimes) to a trained ML model in order to compute quantization encodings and estimate the resulting accuracy of the model when deployed on quantized ML accelerators.\n",

    "2. Convert an FP32 PyTorch model to ONNX and evaluate the model's baseline FP32 accuracy\n",

Also, optimization techniques such as Quantization-Aware Training, AdaRound, and Cross-Layer Equalization can be employed to improve the accuracy of quantized models."

Doing so results in an inferences/sec speedup since unnecessary computation is avoided. Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",

    "Even though AIMET has added 'quantizer' nodes to the model graph, the model is not ready to be used yet. Before we can use the sim model for inference, we need to find appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters for each 'quantizer' node. For activation quantization node, we need to pass unlabeled data samples through the model to collect range statistics which will then let AIMET calculate appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters. This process is sometimes referred to as calibration. AIMET simply refers to it as 'computing encodings'.\n",

This should be fairly simple - use the existing train or validation data loader to extract some samples and pass them to the model. We don't need to compute any loss metric etc. So we can just ignore the model output for this purpose. A few pointers regarding the data samples\n",

It's not necessary that all classes need to be covered etc. since we are only looking at the range of values at every layer activation.
