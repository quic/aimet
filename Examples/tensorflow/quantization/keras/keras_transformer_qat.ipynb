    "# Quantization-Aware Training with a Keras Transformer Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform QAT (Quantization-aware training) for transformer models built in Keras. QAT is an AIMET feature adding quantization simulation ops (also called fake quantization ops sometimes) to a trained ML model and using a standard training pipeline to fine-tune or train the model for a few epochs. The resulting model should show improved accuracy on quantized ML accelerators.\n",
