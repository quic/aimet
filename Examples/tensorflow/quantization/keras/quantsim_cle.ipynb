    "# Cross-Layer Equalization with QuantSim\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an example of how to use AIMET to apply Cross-Layer Equalization (CLE) and use quantization simulation (QuantSim). CLE is post-training quantization technique for improving quantized accuracy of a model. This technique help recover quantized accuracy when the model quantization is sensitive to parameter quantization as opposed to activation quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLE does not need any data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-layer equalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET performs the following steps when running CLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Batch norm (BN) Folding: Folds BN layers into convolution (Conv) layers immediate before or after the Conv layers.\n",
    "2. Cross-layer scaling: For a set of consecutive Conv layers, equalizes the range of tensor values per-channel by scaling their weight tensor values.\n",
    "3. High bias folding: Cross-layer scaling may result in high bias parameter values for some layers. This technique folds some of the bias of a layer into the subsequent layer's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias Correction**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization sometimes leads to a shift in layer outputs. Bias correction helps correct this shift by adjusting the bias parameters of that layer. This step is optional, and is applied after CLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall flow\n",

    "This example performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the FP32 model and evaluate the model to find the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted) and evaluate this simuation model\n",
    "4. Apply CLE, and evaluate the simulation model\n",
