    "# Quantization-Aware Training with BatchNorm Re-estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform QAT (Quantization-aware training) with batchnorm re-estimation.\n",
    "Batchnorm re-estimation is a technique for countering potential instability of batchnrom statistics (i.e. running mean and variance) during QAT. More specifically, batchnorm re-estimation recalculates the batchnorm statistics based on the model after QAT. By doing so, we aim to make our model learn batchnorm statistics from from stable outputs after QAT, rather than from likely noisy outputs during QAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a quantization simulation model with fake quantization ops inserted.\n",
    "2. Finetune and evaluate the quantization simulation model\n",
    "3. Re-estimate batchnorm statistics and compare the eval score before and after re-estimation.\n",
    "4. Fold the re-estimated batchnorm layers and export the quantization simulation model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus how to apply batchnorm re-estimation after QAT, rather than covering all the details about QAT itself. For more information about QAT, please refer to [QAT notebook](https://github.com/quic/aimet/blob/develop/Examples/tensorflow/quantization/qat.ipynb) or [QAT range learning notebook](https://github.com/quic/aimet/blob/develop/Examples/tensorflow/quantization/qat_range_learning.ipynb)."

E.g. the entire ILSVRC2012 dataset has 1000 classes, 1000 training samples per class and 50 validation samples per class. But for the purpose of running this notebook, you could perhaps reduce the dataset to say 2 samples per class and then convert it into tfrecords.

    "## Compute Encodings\n",
    "Even though AIMET has added 'quantizer' nodes to the model graph, the model is not ready to be used yet. Before we can use the sim model for inference or training, we need to find appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters for each 'quantizer' node. For activation quantization nodes, we need to pass unlabeled data samples through the model to collect range statistics which will then let AIMET calculate appropriate scale/offset quantization parameters. This process is sometimes referred to as calibration. AIMET simply refers to it as 'computing encodings'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a routine to pass unlabeled data samples through the model. This should be fairly simple - use the existing train or validation data loader to extract some samples and pass them to the model. We don't need to compute any loss metric etc. So we can just ignore the model output for this purpose. A few pointers regarding the data samples\n",
    "- In practice, we need a very small percentage of the overall data samples for computing encodings. For example, the training dataset for ImageNet has 1M samples. For computing encodings we only need 500 or 1000 samples.\n",
    "- It may be beneficial if the samples used for computing encoding are well distributed. It's not necessary that all classes need to be covered etc. since we are only looking at the range of values at every layer activation. However, we definitely want to avoid an extreme scenario like all 'dark' or 'light' samples are used - e.g. only using pictures captured at night might not give ideal results.\n",
