    "# Cross-Layer Equalization (CLE) and Bias Correction (BC)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases a working code example of how to use AIMET to apply Cross-Layer Equalization (CLE) and Bias Correction (BC). CLE and BC are post-training quantization techniques that aim to improve quantized accuracy of a given model. CLE does not need any data samples. BC may optionally need unlabelled data samples. These techniques help recover quantized accuracy when the model quantization is sensitive to parameter quantization as opposed to activation quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about this techniques, please refer to the \"Data-Free Quantization Through Weight Equalization and Bias Correction\" paper from ICCV 2019 - https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04721\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Layer Equalization**\n",
    "AIMET performs the following steps when running CLE:\n",
    "1. Batch Norm Folding: Folds BN layers into Conv layers immediate before or after the Conv layers.\n",
    "2. Cross-Layer Scaling: Given a set of consecutive Conv layers, equalizes the range of tensor values per-channel by scaling up/down per-channel weight tensor values of a layer and corresponding scaling down/up per-channel weight tensor values of the subsequent layer.\n",
    "3. High Bias Folding: Cross-layer scaling may result in high bias parameter values for some layers. This technique folds some of the bias of a layer into the subsequent layer's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias Correction**  \n",
    "Quantization sometimes leads to a shift in layer outputs. This techniques helps correct this shift by adjusting the bias parameters of that layer. Note that this technique is generally applied after CLE, but it is a optional step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the FP32 model and evaluate the model to find the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted) and evaluate this simuation model to get a quantized accuracy score\n",
    "4. Apply CLE, BC and and evaluate the simulation model to get a post-finetuned quantized accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18. Also, some optimization parameters are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly.\n"

Doing so, results in an inferences/sec speedup since unnecessary computation is avoided. Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",
