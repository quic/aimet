    "# Automatic Mixed-Precision (AMP)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform Auto Mixed Precision (AMP). AMP is a technique where given a quantized accuracy target, AIMET finds bit-precision per-layer to meet that accuracy target while trying to optimize the model for inference speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, say a particular model is not meeting a desired accuracy target when run in INT8. The Auto Mixed Precision feature will find a minimal set of layers that need to run on say INT16 to get to the desired accuracy. It should be noted that choosing higher precision for some layers necessarily involves a trade-off: lower inferences/sec for higher accuracy and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the AMP feature can be used to generate a pareto curve (accuracy vs. bit-ops) that can guide the user to decide the right operating point for this tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook specifically shows working code example for the above. \n",

    "2. Load the FP32 model and evaluate the model to find the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted)\n",
    "4. Run AMP algorithm on the quantized model \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art AMP results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18. Also, some optimization parameters like number of samples for evaluation are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly."

Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",

    "- **sim**: `QuantizationSimModel` object to which mixed precision will be applied.\n",
    "- **dummy_inputs**: Dummy input to the model. If the model has more than one input, pass a tuple. User is expected to place the tensors on the appropriate device.\n",
    "- **eval_callback_for_phase1**: A CallbackFunc object used for measure sensitivity of each quantizer group in phase 1. The phase 1 involves finding accuracy list/sensitivity of each module. Therefore, a user might want to run the phase 1 with a smaller dataset\n",
    "- **eval_callback_for_phase2**: A CallbackFunc object used for evaluating accuracy of quantized model in phase 2. The phase 2 involves finding pareto front curve.\n",
    "- **candidates**: It is a list of tuples for all possible bitwidth values for activations and parameters. Suppose the possible combinations are-((Activation bitwidth - 8, Activation data type - int), (Parameter bitwidth - 16, parameter data type - int)) ((Activation bitwidth - 16, Activation data type - float), (Parameter bitwidth - 16, parameter data type - float)) candidates will be [((8, QuantizationDataType.int), (16, QuantizationDataType.int)), ((16, QuantizationDataType.float), (16, QuantizationDataType.float))]\n",
    "- **allowed_accuracy_drop**: Maximum allowed drop in accuracy from FP32 baseline. The pareto front curve is plotted only till the point where the allowable accuracy drop is met. To get a complete plot for picking points on the curve, the user can set the allowable accuracy drop to None.\n",
    "- **results_dir**: Path to save results and cache intermediate results\n",
    "- **clean_start**: If true, any cached information from previous runs will be deleted prior to starting the mixed-precision analysis. If false, prior cached information will be used if applicable. Note it is the user's responsibility to set this flag to true if anything in the model or quantization parameters changes compared to the previous run.\n",
    "- **use_all_amp_candidates**: Using the “supported_kernels” field in the config file (under defaults and op_type sections), a list of supported candidates can be specified. All the AMP candidates which are passed through the “candidates” field may not be supported based on the data passed through “supported_kernels”. When the field “use_all_amp_candidates” is set to True, the AMP algorithm will ignore the \"supported_kernels\" in the config file and continue to use all candidates.\n",
    "- **forward_pass_callback** A CallbackFunc object which used as forward pass callback for computing quantization encodings.\n",
    "- **amp_search_algo**: An AMPSearchAlgo enum that defines the search algorithm to be used for phase 2. You can choose one of `AMPSearchAlgo.Binary` (default), `AMPSearchAlgo.Interpolation`, and `AMPSearchAlgo.BruteForce`.\n",
