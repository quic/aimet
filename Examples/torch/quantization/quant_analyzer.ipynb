    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases a working code example of how to use AIMET to apply Quant Analyzer.\n",
    "Quant Analyzer is a feature which performs various analyses on a model to understand how each layer in the model responds to quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the following analyses are run:\n",
    "- Compare fp32 accuracy, accuracy with only parameters quantized, and accuracy with only activations quantized\n",
    "- For each layer, track the model accuracy when quantization for all other layers is disabled (enabling quantization for only one layer in the model at a time)\n",
    "- For each layer, track the model accuracy when quantization for all other layers is enabled (disabling quantization for only one layer in the model at a time)\n",
    "- Track the minimum and maximum encoding parameters calculated by each quantizer in the model as a result of forward passes through the model with representative data\n",
    "- When the TF Enhanced quantization scheme is used, track the histogram of tensor ranges seen by each quantizer in the model as a result of forward passes through the model with representative data\n",
    "- If enabled, track the MSE loss seen at each layer by comparing layer outputs of the original fp32 model vs. a quantized model\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET will also output .html plots and json files where appropriate for each analysis to help visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following output files will be produced, in a folder specified by the user:\n",
    "- per_layer_quant_enabled.html: A plot with layers on the x-axis and model accuracy on the y-axis, where each layer's accuracy represents the model accuracy when all quantizers in the model are disabled except for that layer's parameter and activation quantizers.\n",
    "- per_layer_quant_enabled.json: A json file containing the data shown in per_layer_quant_enabled.html, associating layer names with model accuracy.\n",
    "- per_layer_quant_disabled.html: A plot with layers on the x-axis and model accuracy on the y-axis, where each layer's accuracy represents the model accuracy when all quantizers in the model are enabled except for that layer's parameter and activation quantizers.\n",
    "- per_layer_quant_disabled.json: A json file containing the data shown in per_layer_quant_disabled.html, associating layer names with model accuracy.\n",
    "- (Optional, if per layer MSE loss is enabled) per_layer_mse_loss.html: A plot with layers on the x-axis and MSE loss on the y-axis, where each layer's MSE loss represents the MSE seen comparing that layer's outputs in the FP32 model vs. the quantized model.\n",
    "- (Optional, if per layer MSE loss is enabled) per_layer_mse_loss.json: A json file containing the data shown in per_layer_mse_loss.html, associating layer names with MSE loss.\n",
    "- min_max_ranges: A folder containing the following sets of files:\n",
    "    - activations.html: A plot with output activations on the x-axis and min-max values on the y-axis, where each output activation's range represents the encoding min and max parameters computed during forward pass calibration (explained below).\n",
    "    - activations.json: A json file containing the data shown in activations.html, associating layer names with min and max encoding values.\n",
    "    - weights.html: A plot with parameter names on the x-axis and min-max values on the y-axis, where each parameter's range represents the encoding min and max parameters computed during forward pass calibration.\n",
    "    - weights.json: A json file containing the data shown in weights.html, associating parameter names with min and max encoding values.\n",
    "- (If TF Enhanced quant scheme is used) activations_pdf: A folder containing html files for each layer, plotting the histogram of tensor values seen for that layer's output activation seen during forward pass calibration.\n",
    "- (If TF Enhanced quant scheme is used) weights_pdf: A folder containing subfolders for each layer with weights.\n",
    "  Each layer's folder contains html files for each parameter of that layer, with a histogram plot of tensor values seen for that parameter seen during forward pass calibration.\n",
