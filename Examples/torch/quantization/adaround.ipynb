    "# Adaptive Rounding (AdaRound)\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform Adaptive Rounding (AdaRound).\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET quantization features typically use the \"nearest rounding\" technique for achieving quantization.\n",
    "When using the \"nearest rounding\" technique, the weight value is quantized to the nearest integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaRound optimizes a loss function using unlabeled training data to decide whether to quantize a specific weight to the closer integer value or the farther one.\n",
    "Using AdaRound quantization, a model is able to achieve an accuracy closer to the FP32 model, while using low bit-width integer quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following:\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the FP32 model and evaluate the model to find the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted) and evaluate this simuation model to get a quantized accuracy score\n",
    "4. Apply AdaRound and evaluate the simulation model to get a post-finetuned quantized accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art results\n",
    "* For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18\n",
    "* Also, some optimization parameters are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly"
