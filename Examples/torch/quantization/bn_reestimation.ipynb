    "# Quantization-Aware Training with BatchNorm Re-estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform QAT (Quantization-aware training) with batchnorm re-estimation.\n",
    "Batchnorm re-estimation is a technique for countering potential instability of batchnrom statistics (i.e. running mean and variance) during QAT. More specifically, batchnorm re-estimation recalculates the batchnorm statistics based on the model after QAT. By doing so, we aim to make our model learn batchnorm statistics from from stable outputs after QAT, rather than from likely noisy outputs during QAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a quantization simulation model with fake quantization ops inserted.\n",
    "2. Finetune and evaluate the quantization simulation model\n",
    "3. Re-estimate batchnorm statistics and compare the eval score before and after re-estimation.\n",
    "4. Fold the re-estimated batchnorm layers and export the quantization simulation model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus how to apply batchnorm re-estimation after QAT, rather than covering all the details about QAT itself. For more information about QAT, please refer to [QAT notebook](https://github.com/quic/aimet/blob/develop/Examples/torch/quantization/quantization_aware_training.ipynb) or [QAT range learning notebook](https://github.com/quic/aimet/blob/develop/Examples/torch/quantization/qat_range_learning.ipynb)."
