    "# Quantization-Aware Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET to perform QAT (Quantization-aware training). QAT is an AIMET feature adding quantization simulation ops (also called fake quantization ops sometimes) to a trained ML model and using a standard training pipeline to fine-tune or train the model for a few epochs. The resulting model should show improved accuracy on quantized ML accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET supports two different types of QAT\n",
    "1. Simply referred to as QAT - quantization parameters like per-tensor scale/offsets for activations are computed once. During fine-tuning, the model weights are updated to minimize the effects of quantization in the forward pass, keeping the quantization parameters constant.\n",
    "2. Referred to as QAT with range-learning - quantization parameters like per-tensor scale/offsets for activations are computed initially. Then both the quantization parameters and the model weights are jointly updated during fine-tuning to minimize the effects of quantization in the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook specifically shows working code example for #1 above. You can find a separate notebook for #2 in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Instantiate the example evaluation and training pipeline\n",
    "2. Load the FP32 model and evaluate the model to find the baseline FP32 accuracy\n",
    "3. Create a quantization simulation model (with fake quantization ops inserted) and evaluate this simuation model to get a quantized accuracy score\n",
    "4. Fine-tune the quantization simulation model and evaluate the simulation model to get a post-finetuned quantized accuracy score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "* This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art QAT results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18. Also, some optimization parameters like number of epochs to fine-tune are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly."

Now from a floating point compute perspective, a BN-folded model is mathematically equivalent to a model with BN layers from an inference perspective, and produces the same accuracy. However, folding the BN layers can increase the range of the tensor values for the weight parameters of the adjacent layers. And this can have a negative impact on the quantized accuracy of the model (especially when using INT8 or lower precision). So, we want to simulate that on-target behavior by doing BN folding here.\n",
