## Requirements
The AIMET package requires the following host platform setup:
- 64-bit Intel x86-compatible processor
- Linux Ubuntu: 18.04 LTS
- bash command shell
- For GPU variants:
  - Nvidia GPU card (Compute capability 5.2 or later)
  - nvidia-docker - Installation instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

To use the GPU accelerated training modules an Nvidia CUDA enabled GPU with a minimum Nvidia driver version of 455+ is required. Using the latest driver is always recommended, especially if using a newer GPU. Both CUDA and cuDNN (the more advanced CUDA interface) enabled GPUs are supported.

Recommended host system hardware requirements:
- Intel i7 multicore CPU w/hyperthreading
- 16+ GB RAM
- 500GB+ SSD hard drive
- For GPU variants:
  - GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 or Tesla V100

While these are not minimum requirements, they are recommended for good performance when training large networks.

## Get the code
To obtain the code, first define a workspace and follow these instructions:

```bash
WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
mkdir $WORKSPACE && cd $WORKSPACE
git clone https://github.com/quic/aimet.git
```
Clone the google test repo as follows:
```
cd aimet
mkdir -p ./ThirdParty/googletest
pushd ./ThirdParty/googletest
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b release-1.8.0 googletest-release-1.8.0
popd
```

## Setup the environment
In order to build and run AIMET code, several dependencies are required (such as python, cmake, tensorflow, pytorch, etc). [Docker files](../Jenkins) and [Docker images](https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/ui/native/codelinaro-aimet/aimet-dev) with all prerequisites and dependencies are available for each AIMET variant. Following are the available development options:
- Use the appropriate [pre-built Docker image](https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/ui/native/codelinaro-aimet/aimet-dev) using the instructions [here](#docker-information). This is the *recommended* option.
- Build the docker image locally and launch a launch container docker using the instructions [here](#docker-information).
- Install the dependencies on your machine and setup your environment using [the appropriate Dockerfile](../Jenkins) as a guide.

Set the *common* environment variables as follows:
```bash
source $WORKSPACE/aimet/packaging/envsetup.sh
```

## Build code and install
Follow these instructions to build the AIMET code:

> NOTE: **If you are inside the docker, set `WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"` again.**
```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aimet
mkdir build && cd build

# Run cmake (be sure to set the flags in the below command depending on your variant)
# To build for GPU, use -DENABLE_CUDA=ON. To build for CPU, use -DENABLE_CUDA=OFF.
# To include torch, use -DENABLE_TORCH=ON. To exclude torch, use -DENABLE_TORCH=OFF.
# To include tensorflow, use -DENABLE_TENSORFLOW=ON. To exclude tensorflow, use -DENABLE_TENSORFLOW=OFF.
cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DENABLE_CUDA=ON -DENABLE_TORCH=ON -DENABLE_TENSORFLOW=ON

make -j8 
```

After a successful build, install the package using the following instructions:
```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aimet/build
make install
```
Once the installation step is complete, the AIMET package is created at `$WORKSPACE/aimet/build/staging/universal/lib/`.

## Setup paths
Setup the package and library paths as follows:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$WORKSPACE/aimet/build/staging/universal/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
```
At this point, we are all set to use AIMET!

## Usage examples and documentation
The following steps would generate AIMET documentation including the user guide, examples and API documentation at `$WORKSPACE/aimet/build/staging/universal/Docs`:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aimet/build
make doc
```

To begin navigating the documentation, open the page `$WORKSPACE/aimet/build/staging/universal/Docs/user_guide/index.html` on any browser.

## Docker information
Code may *optionally* be developed inside a development docker container. This section describes how to build a docker image and launch a container using the provided [Dockerfiles](../Jenkins).

### Set variant
Set the `<variant_string>` to ONE of the following depending on your desired variant
- For the PyTorch GPU variant, use `"torch-gpu"`
- For the PyTorch CPU variant, use `"torch-cpu"`
- For the TensorFlow GPU variant, use `"tf-gpu"`
- For the TensorFlow CPU variant, use `"tf-cpu"`
```bash
export AIMET_VARIANT=<variant_string>
```

### Use prebuilt docker image
Follow these instructions to use one of the pre-built docker images:
```bash
WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
docker_image_name="artifacts.codelinaro.org/codelinaro-aimet/aimet-dev:latest.${AIMET_VARIANT}"
docker_container_name="aimet-dev-<any_name>"
```

> NOTE: Feel free to modify the `docker_container_name` as needed.

### Build docker image locally
Follow these instructions ONLY if you want to build the docker image locally. If not, skip to the next section.
```bash
WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
docker_image_name="aimet-dev-docker:<any_tag>"
docker_container_name="aimet-dev-<any_name>"
docker build -t ${docker_image_name} -f $WORKSPACE/aimet/Jenkins/Dockerfile.${AIMET_VARIANT} .
```

> NOTE: Feel free to modify the `docker_image_name` and `docker_container_name` as needed.

### Start docker container manually
Ensure that a docker named `$docker_container_name` is not already running; otherwise remove the existing container and then start a new container as follows:
```bash
docker ps -a | grep ${docker_container_name} && docker kill ${docker_container_name}

docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
  -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
  -v ${HOME}:${HOME} -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE} \
  -v "/local/mnt/workspace":"/local/mnt/workspace" \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash -w ${WORKSPACE} --hostname ${docker_container_name} ${docker_image_name}
```

> **NOTE**
* Feel free to modify the above `docker run` command based on the environment and filesystem on your host machine.
* If nvidia-docker 2.0 is installed, then add `--gpus all` to the `docker run` commands in order to enable GPU access inside the docker container.
* If nvidia-docker 1.0 is installed, then replace `docker run` with `nvidia-docker run` in order to enable GPU access inside the docker container. 
* Port forwarding needs to be done in order to run the Visualization APIs from docker container. This can be achieved by running the docker container as follows:

```bash
port_id="<any-port-number>"

docker run -p ${port_id}:${port_id} --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
  -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
  -v ${HOME}:${HOME} -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE} \
  -v "/local/mnt/workspace":"/local/mnt/workspace" \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash -w ${WORKSPACE} --hostname ${docker_container_name} ${docker_image_name} 
```

### Build and launch docker using script
The development docker may also be built and launched in interactive mode using the provided script as follows:

> **_NOTE:_** Add the '-l' option to use the pre-built docker image.

```
cd aimet
./buildntest.sh -e AIMET_VARIANT -i [-l]
```
If additional directories need to be mounted, use `-m` option with list of targeted directories separated by space **surrounded by double quotes `""`**
```
cd aimet
./buildntest.sh -e AIMET_VARIANT -i -m "sample_dir_1 sample_dir2" [-l]
```

To help construct user-specific docker commands, the dry-run option (`-n`) can be used with the above script which prints out the equivalent docker command(s):
```
cd aimet
./buildntest.sh -e AIMET_VARIANT -i -n [-l]
# OR
./buildntest.sh -e AIMET_VARIANT -i -n -m "sample_dir_1 sample_dir2" [-l]
```
