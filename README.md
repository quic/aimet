# AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET)

<a href="https://quic.github.io/aimet-pages/index.html">AIMET</a> is a library that provides advanced model quantization 
and compression techniques for trained neural network models.
It provides features that have been proven to improve run-time performance of deep learning neural network models with 
lower compute and memory requirements and minimal impact to task accuracy.  


![How AIMET works](Docs/images/how-it-works.png)

AIMET is designed to work with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) models.

We also host the [AIMET Model Zoo](https://github.com/quic/aimet-model-zoo) - a collection of popular neural network models optimized for 8-bit inference.
We also provide recipes for users to quantize floating point models using AIMET.

#### Installation
```
apt-get install liblapacke
python3 -m pip install aimet-torch
```

To install other AIMET variants and versions, please follow one of the links below for instructions:

- [Build, install and run AIMET from source in *Docker* environment](./packaging/docker_install.md)


## Why AIMET?

![Benefits of AIMET](Docs/images/AImodelEfficency.png)

* **Supports advanced quantization techniques**: Inference using integer runtimes is significantly faster than using floating-point runtimes. For example, models run
5x-15x faster on the Qualcomm Hexagon DSP than on the Qualcomm Kyro CPU. In addition, 8-bit precision models have a 4x 
smaller footprint than 32-bit precision models. However, maintaining model accuracy when quantizing ML models is often 
challenging.  AIMET solves this using novel techniques like Data-Free Quantization that provide state-of-the-art INT8 results on 
several popular models. 
* **Supports advanced model compression techniques** that enable models to run faster at inference-time and require less memory
* **AIMET is designed to automate optimization** of neural networks avoiding time-consuming and tedious manual tweaking.
AIMET also provides user-friendly APIs that allow users to make calls directly from their [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) 
or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) pipelines.

## Supported Features

#### Quantization

* *Cross-Layer Equalization*: Equalize weight tensors to reduce amplitude variation across channels
* *Bias Correction*: Corrects shift in layer outputs introduced due to quantization
* *Adaptive Rounding*: Learn the optimal rounding given unlabelled data
* *Quantization Simulation*: Simulate on-target quantized inference accuracy
* *Quantization-aware Training*: Use quantization simulation to train the model further to improve accuracy

#### Model Compression

* *Spatial SVD*: Tensor decomposition technique to split a large layer into two smaller ones
* *Channel Pruning*: Removes redundant input channels from a layer and reconstructs layer weights
* *Per-layer compression-ratio selection*: Automatically selects how much to compress each layer in the model

#### Visualization

* *Weight ranges*: Inspect visually if a model is a candidate for applying the Cross Layer Equalization technique. And the effect after applying the technique
* *Per-layer compression sensitivity*: Visually get feedback about the sensitivity of any given layer in the model to compression

## What's New
Some recently added features include
* Adaptive Rounding (AdaRound): Learn the optimal rounding given unlabelled data
* Quantization-aware Training (QAT) for recurrent models (including with RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs)

## Results

AIMET can quantize an existing 32-bit floating-point model to an 8-bit fixed-point model without sacrificing much accuracy and without model fine-tuning. 


<h4>DFQ</h4>

The DFQ method applied to several popular networks, such as MobileNet-v2 and ResNet-50, result in less than 0.9% 
loss in accuracy all the way down to 8-bit quantization, in an automated way without any training data.

<h4>AdaRound (Adaptive Rounding)</h4>
<h5>ADAS Object Detect</h5>
<p>For this example ADAS object detection model, which was challenging to quantize to 8-bit precision, 
AdaRound can recover the accuracy to within 1% of the FP32 accuracy.</p>

<h5>DeepLabv3 Semantic Segmentation</h5>
<p>For some models like the DeepLabv3 semantic segmentation model, AdaRound can even quantize the model weights to 
4-bit precision without a significant drop in accuracy.</p>

<h4>Quantization for Recurrent Models</h4>
<p>AIMET supports quantization simulation and quantization-aware training (QAT) for recurrent models (RNN, LSTM, GRU). 
Using QAT feature in AIMET, a DeepSpeech2 model with bi-directional LSTMs can be quantized to 8-bit precision with 
minimal drop in accuracy.</p>

<table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>DeepSpeech2 <br>(using bi-directional LSTMs)</th>

  <tr>
    <td>INT8</td>
    <td align="center">10.22%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

<h4>Model Compression</h4>
<p>AIMET can also significantly compress models. For popular models, such as Resnet-50 and Resnet-18, 
compression with spatial SVD plus channel pruning achieves 50% MAC (multiply-accumulate) reduction while retaining 
accuracy within approx. 1% of the original uncompressed model.</p>
