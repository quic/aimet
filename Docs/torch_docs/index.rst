AIMET: AI Model Efficiency Toolkit Documentation
================================================

AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) provides tools enabling users to quantize and compress PyTorch models. Quantization
is an essential step when deploying models to edge devices with fixed-point AI accelerators.

AIMET provides both post-training and fine-tuning techniques to minimize accuracy loss incurred when quantizing
floating-point models.

The above picture shows a high-level view of the workflow when using AIMET. The user passes a trained floating-point
model to AIMET's APIs for quantization. AIMET returns a new PyTorch model simulating low-precision inference, which users
can fine-tune to recover lost accuracy. Users can then export the quantized model via ONNX/torchscript to an on-target
runtime like Qualcomm\ |reg| Neural Processing SDK.

   Installation <../install/index>
   Quickstart Guide <tutorials/quickstart_guide>


**Pip Installation:**

.. code-block:: console

    apt-get install liblapacke
    python3 -m pip install aimet-torch

For more installation options, please visit the :ref:`AIMET installation instructions<ug-installation>`.


**Basic Usage:**

.. code-block:: Python

    import aimet_torch.v2 as aimet

    # Create quantization simulation model for your model
    sim = aimet.quantsim.QuantizationSimModel(model, sample_input)

    # Calibrate quantization encodings on sample data
    with aimet.nn.compute_encodings(sim.model):
        for data, _ in data_loader:
            sim.model(data)

    # Simulate quantized inference
    sample_output = sim.model(sample_input)

    # Export model and quantization encodings
    sim.export("./out_dir", "quantized_model", sample_input)

Please view the :ref:`Quickstart Guide<ug-torch-quickstart>` for a more in-depth guide to using AIMET quantsim.
