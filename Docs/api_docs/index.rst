Welcome to AI Model Efficiency Toolkit API Docs!
================================================

AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) is a software toolkit that enables users to compress
and quantize ML models. The resulting models returned by AIMET can be further trained (or fine-tuned)
to dramatically improve accuracy lost due to quantization and compression.

AIMET is designed to work generically on any user-provided model. At present, AIMET supports
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and ONNX frameworks.

Please follow the links below to see AIMET APIs for either PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, or ONNX.

.. note:: AIMET Keras API requires Tensorflow 2.4 or later.
