Welcome to AIMET API docs!
==========================

**AIMET (AI Model Efficiency Toolkit)** is a software toolkit that enables users to compress
and quantize ML models. The resulting models returned by AIMET can be further trained (or fine-tuned)
to dramatically improve accuracy lost due to quantization and compression.

**AIMET** is designed to work generically on any user-provided model. At present, AIMET supports
TensorFlow and PyTorch training frameworks.

Please follow the links below to see AIMET APIs for either TensorFlow or PyTorch.
