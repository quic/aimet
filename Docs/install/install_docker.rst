AIMET Installation in Docker
##############################

This page provides instructions to install AIMET package inside a development docker container.

Set variant
~~~~~~~~~~~
Set the `<variant_string>` to ONE of the following depending on your desired variant
    #. For the PyTorch 2.1 GPU variant, use `torch-gpu`
    #. For the PyTorch 2.1 CPU variant, use `torch-cpu`
    #. For the PyTorch 1.13 GPU variant, use `torch-gpu-pt113`
    #. For the PyTorch 1.13 CPU variant, use `torch-cpu-pt113`
    #. For the TensorFlow GPU variant, use `tf-gpu`
    #. For the TensorFlow CPU variant, use `tf-cpu`
    #. For the ONNX GPU variant, use `onnx-gpu`
    #. For the ONNX CPU variant, use `onnx-cpu`

.. code-block:: bash

    export AIMET_VARIANT=<variant_string>


Use prebuilt docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow these instructions to use one of the pre-built docker images:

.. code-block:: bash

    WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
    docker_image_name="artifacts.codelinaro.org/codelinaro-aimet/aimet-dev:latest.${AIMET_VARIANT}"
    docker_container_name="aimet-dev-<any_name>"

**NOTE:** Feel free to modify the `docker_container_name` as needed.

Build docker image locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow these instructions ONLY if you want to build the docker image locally. If not, skip to the next section.

.. code-block:: bash

    WORKSPACE="<absolute_path_to_workspace>"
    docker_image_name="aimet-dev-docker:<any_tag>"
    docker_container_name="aimet-dev-<any_name>"
    docker build -t ${docker_image_name} -f $WORKSPACE/aimet/Jenkins/Dockerfile.${AIMET_VARIANT} .

**NOTE:** Feel free to modify the `docker_image_name` and `docker_container_name` as needed.

Start docker container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ensure that a docker named `$docker_container_name` is not already running; otherwise remove the existing container and then start a new container as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker ps -a | grep ${docker_container_name} && docker kill ${docker_container_name}

    docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    -v ${HOME}:${HOME} -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE} \
    -v "/local/mnt/workspace":"/local/mnt/workspace" \
    --entrypoint /bin/bash -w ${WORKSPACE} --hostname ${docker_container_name} ${docker_image_name}


**NOTE:**
    #. Feel free to modify the above `docker run` command based on the environment and filesystem on your host machine.
    #. If nvidia-docker 2.0 is installed, then add `--gpus all` to the `docker run` commands in order to enable GPU access inside the docker container.
    #. If nvidia-docker 1.0 is installed, then replace `docker run` with `nvidia-docker run` in order to enable GPU access inside the docker container.
    #. Port forwarding needs to be done in order to run the Visualization APIs from docker container. This can be achieved by running the docker container as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    port_id="<any-port-number>"

    docker run -p ${port_id}:${port_id} --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    -v ${HOME}:${HOME} -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE} \
    -v "/local/mnt/workspace":"/local/mnt/workspace" \
    --entrypoint /bin/bash -w ${WORKSPACE} --hostname ${docker_container_name} ${docker_image_name}

Install AIMET packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From PyPI
=========

Aimet Torch GPU can install from pypi through the following method:

Go to https://pypi.org/project/aimet-torch to identify a version you wish to install

    - For PyTorch 1.13 GPU you should use aimet-torch==1.31.1
    - For Pytorch 2.1.2 GPU you should use aimet-torch >= 1.32.0

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install liblapacke -y
    pip install aimet-torch


From Release Package
====================

We also host python wheel packages for different variants which may be installed as follows:
    - Go to https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases
    - Identify the release tag of the package that you wish to install
    - Identify the .whl file corresponding to the package variant that you wish to install
    - Follow the instructions below to install AIMET from the .whl file

Set the package details as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Set the release tag ex. "1.33.0"
    export release_tag="<version release tag>"

    # Construct the download root URL
    export download_url="https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases/download/${release_tag}"

    # Set the wheel file name with extension
    # ex. "aimet_torch_gpu-1.33.0.cu117-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl"
    export wheel_file_name="<wheel file name>"

Install the selected AIMET package as specified below:
**NOTE:** Python dependencies will automatically get installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install ${download_url}/${wheel_file_name}


Environment setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the common environment variables as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    source /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/aimet_common/bin/envsetup.sh
