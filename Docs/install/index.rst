AIMET Installation
##################

This page contains instructions for the following installation scenarios:

- :ref:`Quick Install of the latest version for PyTorch <idx-install-quick>`
- :ref:`Installation of the latest version for all platforms <idx-install-latest>`
- :ref:`Installation of older versions <idx-install-older>`

You can also:

- :doc:`Install manually on a host machine <install_host>`
- :doc:`Install a pre-built or locally built image in a Docker container <install_docker>`

.. note::
    
    The following system requirements apply to all installations.

System requirements
===================

The AIMET package requires the following host platform setup:

* 64-bit Intel x86-compatible processor
* Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Python 3.10) or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Python 3.8)
* bash command shell
* For GPU variants:
    * Nvidia GPU card (Compute capability 5.2 or later)
    * Nvidia driver version 455 or later (using the latest driver is recommended; both CUDA and cuDNN are supported)
    * nvidia-docker - Installation instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

.. _idx-install-quick:

Quick Install
=============

The fastest way to install AIMET is to use the AIMET PyTorch GPU PyPI packages.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following software versions are required for the quick install:

* CUDA 12.0
* Torch 2.2.2

Ensure that you have the LAPACK linear algebra and libpython3-dev development packages installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install liblapacke libpython3-dev

Installation
------------

- **Type the following command to install AIMET using Pip:**

.. code-block::

    python3 -m pip install aimet-torch


Next steps
----------

See the :doc:`Quantization User Guide </user_guide/model_quantization>` for a discussion of how to use AIMET quantization.

See the :doc:`Examples Documentation </user_guide/examples>` to try AIMET on example quantization and compression problems.


.. _idx-install-latest:

Installing  the latest version with release packages
====================================================

Install the latest version of any AIMET variant from the **.whl** files hosted at https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases.


Prerequisites
-------------

These prerequisites apply to all frameworks and variants.

Ensure that you have the LAPACK linear algebra and libpython3-dev development packages installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install liblapacke libpython3-dev

Install a compatible version of pip. The latest version is *not* compatible with our wheel packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install pip==24.0

Choose and install a package
----------------------------

Use one of the following commands to install AIMET based on your choice of framework and runtime environment.

.. note::
    
    Python dependencies are automatically installed.
