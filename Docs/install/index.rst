###################

Quick Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AIMET PyTorch GPU PyPI packages are available for environments that meet the following requirements:

* 64-bit Intel x86-compatible processor
* Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS [Python 3.10] or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS [Python 3.8]
* CUDA 12.0
* Torch 2.2.2

**Pip install**

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install liblapacke libpython3.10-dev
    python3 -m pip install aimet-torch


Release Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For other AIMET variants, install the *latest* version from the .whl files hosted at https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases

**Prerequisite**

The following pre-requisites apply to all variants. The GPU variants may need additional packages - please see `Advanced Installation Instructions`_ for details. 

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get update && apt-get install liblapacke libpython3.10-dev

**PyTorch**

.. parsed-literal::

    # Pytorch 2.1 with CUDA 12.x
    python3 -m pip install |download_url|\ |version|/aimet_torch-\ |version|.cu121\ |whl_suffix| -f |torch_pkg_url|

    # Pytorch 2.1 CPU only
    python3 -m pip install |download_url|\ |version|/aimet_torch-\ |version|.cpu\ |whl_suffix| -f |torch_pkg_url|

    # ONNX 1.16 CPU
    python3 -m pip install |download_url|\ |version|/aimet_onnx-\ |version|.cpu\ |whl_suffix| -f |torch_pkg_url|


For older versions, please browse the releases at https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases and follow the documentation corresponding to that release to select and install the appropriate package.

.. |whl_suffix| replace:: -cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl

.. |torch_pkg_url| replace:: \https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AIMET package requires the following host platform setup:

* 64-bit Intel x86-compatible processor
* Linux Ubuntu: 22.04 LTS
* bash command shell
* For GPU variants:
    * Nvidia GPU card (Compute capability 5.2 or later)
    * nvidia-docker - Installation instructions: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

To use the GPU accelerated training modules an Nvidia CUDA enabled GPU with a minimum Nvidia driver version of 455+ is required. Using the latest driver is always recommended, especially if using a newer GPU. Both CUDA and cuDNN (the more advanced CUDA interface) enabled GPUs are supported.


Advanced Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to setup and install AIMET:
    * On your host machine
    * Using our pre-built development `Docker images <https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/ui/native/codelinaro-aimet/aimet-dev>`_
